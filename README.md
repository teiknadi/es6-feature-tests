# ES6 Feature Tests

Simple adaptation of Kyle Simpson's [ES Feature Tests](https://github.com/getify/ES-Feature-Tests) to use directly in the browser.

## Use

Just run `index.html` file in the required browser.

There are two available methods to display the data: in a form of the table and as a JSON.

```js
    Es6FetureTests.showTable();
    // or
    Es6FetureTests.showJson();
```
